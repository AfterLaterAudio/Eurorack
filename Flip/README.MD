Schematic and board files for Flip, a 1U version of Mutable Intruments Branches.

While I encourage folks to DIY this module, I ask that if folks make them, do not sell them new below our listed price. I have taken a lot of factors into consideration in setting the price and request that others follow this guidance. Used modules fall outside this guidance. This is not meant to adjust or ammend the cc-by-sa license, it is simply a request.
