You will find all of the design files, including gerbers, board file, schematic, full BOM, and pick and place files. I did use TSSOP packages so please be aware of the fine pin pitch. I've tried to make it easy for folks to leverage PCBA services (like JLC). Learning to work with those services dramatically changed my design process and I'm hoping others can benefit from this as well.

I do not publish panel files. If someone would like to contribute a panel file please raise a PR.

While I encourage folks to DIY this module, I ask that if folks make them, do not sell them new below our listed price. I have taken a lot of factors into consideration in setting the price and request that others follow this guidance. Used modules fall outside this guidance. This is not meant to adjust or ammend the cc-by-sa license, it is simply a request.

I decided to design this while on a walk on the Chief Sealth trail in Seattle.  When walking South on the trail you get a fantastic view of Mt Rainier.  When you look at this module in your rack, let it be a reminder to get out and go for a walk/hike.  It might help with a little creative spark.

Thanks to Emilie Gillet for the original design and code.  Thanks to Jim Mattheson for the Pique design.
