You will find all of the design files, including gerbers, board file, schematic, full BOM, and pick and place files.  I did use TSSOP packages so please be aware of the fine pin pitch.  I've tried to make it easy for folks to leverage PCBA services (like JLC).  Learning to work with those services dramatically changed my design process and I'm hoping others can benefit from this as well.

You can get a nearly complete module by using the JLC assembly service.  I have chosen to publish the LSCS catalog numbers that I used in the prototypes, but I do not plan to maintain those numbers as JLC rotates stock/numbers frequently.  So please double check that the parts look right, this is especially important months/years from this original publish.

I do not publish panel files.  If someone would like to contribute a panel file please raise a PR.

I have only made a single change to the original filter schematic, by adusting the trimmers in the v/oct calibration circuit to allow for a wider range.  I recommend that folks use Alfa Rpar AS2164 ICs for this build.  We have found a much more consistent sound versus the Cool Audio versions, especially at the extreme ends of performance.  Cabintech in the US and Thonk in the EU are great sources for the Alfa chips.

While I encourage folks to DIY this module, I ask that if folks make them, do not sell them new below our listed price. I have taken a lot of factors into consideration in setting the price and request that others follow this guidance.  Used modules fall outside this guidance.  This is not meant to adjust or ammend the cc-by-sa license, it is simply a request.
